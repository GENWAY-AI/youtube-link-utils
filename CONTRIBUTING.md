- **Testing**: Confirmation of test coverage and execution
- **Documentation**: Updates to docs and type definitions
- **Checklist**: Code quality and review items

Please fill out all relevant sections when creating your pull request.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new code
- **Formatting**: Follow existing code formatting (Prettier + ESLint)
- **Naming**: Use meaningful, descriptive variable and function names
- **Functions**: Keep functions small, focused, and pure when possible
- **Types**: Provide comprehensive type definitions

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit tests**: Write tests for all new functionality
- **Test coverage**: Maintain high test coverage
- **Test names**: Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- **Edge cases**: Test both success and error cases
- **Mocking**: Mock external dependencies appropriately (like axios)
- **Browser compatibility**: Consider testing in different environments

### Documentation Standards

- **README.md**: Update for new features with usage examples
- **Type definitions**: Include TypeScript definitions for all public APIs
- **Examples**: Provide clear usage examples
- **Changelog**: Document all changes in CHANGELOG.md

### Commit Message Convention

Use conventional commit format for clear change history:

```
type(scope): brief description

[optional longer description]

[optional footer with breaking changes or issue references]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `test`: Adding or updating tests

**Examples:**

```
feat: add playlist URL validation support
fix: handle malformed URLs gracefully in extractYouTubeVideoId
docs: update React hook usage examples
test: add edge cases for URL parsing
refactor: simplify video ID extraction logic
```

## Library Architecture

### Core Principles

- **Browser-first**: Designed to work in browsers with Node.js compatibility
- **Minimal dependencies**: Keep external dependencies to a minimum
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive types
- **Tree-shaking**: Support for tree-shaking in bundlers
- **Peer dependencies**: Use peer dependencies for optional features

### File Structure

- `src/`: Source code
  - `utils/`: Core utility functions
  - `react/`: React-specific hooks and components
  - `types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions
  - `consts.ts`: Constants and configuration
- `tests/`: Test files mirroring src structure
- Configuration files for build, lint, and test tools

## Release Process

Releases are handled by maintainers following semantic versioning:

- **Patch** (1.0.1): Bug fixes, minor improvements
- **Minor** (1.1.0): New features, backward compatible changes
- **Major** (2.0.0): Breaking changes

The release process includes:

1. Update version in package.json
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
3. Create git tag
4. Publish to npm
5. Create GitHub release

## Getting Help

If you need help or have questions:

- **Check documentation**: README.md and code comments
- **Search issues**: Look for similar questions or problems
- **Create an issue**: Use the "question" label for general questions
- **Discussion**: Use GitHub Discussions for broader topics

## Recognition

All contributors will be recognized in our README.md and release notes. We appreciate every contribution, whether it's code, documentation, bug reports, or feature suggestions!
